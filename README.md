Parabeac Eggs are plugins to modify the way design elements get converted through the use of semantics. It is one of the most exciting things about Parabeac-Core as a whole.

Below is a list of parabeac developed eggs & community developed eggs. Some eggs like `tab_bar` rely on sub eggs like tab. We currently don't support automatic dependency downloads so if you see an egg that has a sub egg, you'll have to install it manually. You can learn how to install an egg __here__. If you'd like to add your egg to this repo, email us at dev@parabeac.com or make a PR!

   * [Tab](https://github.com/Parabeac/parabeac_eggs/tree/master/internal_eggs/tab)

We are working on creating a full marketplace for eggs but in the meantime, please bear with us & send us your eggs!!!
